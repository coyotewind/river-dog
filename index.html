                        This is me just learning to crawl. Not too much to report here. You can play a simple game by manually entering moves for both players. There is only one check for win, if you make player one have three in a row, in the top row.

                    <div class="text">
                        I used a 1D array for my game state and was a little stuck. Plus my initial check for wins was simply brute force, and it would not have been great to write out a complex conditions with 16 iterations. Hence I abandoned it early for a different approach.

                    <div class="text">
                        Here I am walking, taking my first baby steps towards working with a 2D array and a more complex rule set. Again both players are manual entry, however the UI is improved and there is a proper check for wins now.

                    <div class="text">
                        The biggest challenge was learning how to extract the data saved in the game state array and use it for the check for wins. Eventually that all came together. I was able to explore using nested loops and I also created a game over check, which was useful.

                        Finally getting my stride, although still not flying. Here I was able to make is so that the computer plays their move autmatically. This was most definitely the most challenging and interesting part of the project.

                        This was a great exercise in learning to interact more with arrays; I was able to make a counter to integrate with my check for a draw function, and learned to set a time-out to make the computer's turn seem more natural. Yet there is a very subtle bug here. Can you find it?
