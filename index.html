                        This is me just learning to crawl. Not too much to report here. You can play a simple game by manually entering moves for both players. There is only one check for win, if you make player one have three in a row, in the top row.
                    </div>
                    <div class="text">
                        I used a 1D array for my game state and was a little stuck. My initial check for wins was simply brute force, and it would not have been great to write out a complex conditional with 16 iterations. Hence I abandoned it early for a different approach.
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="col">
                    <a href="./tic-tac-toe-2"><span>Version<br>Two</span></a>
                    <div class="text">
                        Here I am walking, taking my first baby steps towards working with a 2D array and a more complex rule set. Again both players are manual entry, however the UI is improved and there is a proper check for wins now.
                    </div>
                    <div class="text">
                        The biggest challenge was learning how to extract the data saved in the game state array and use it for the check for wins. Eventually that all came together. I was able to explore using nested loops and I also created a game over check, which was useful.
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="col">
                    <a href="./tic-tac-toe-3"><span>Version<br>Three</span></a>
                    <div class="text">
                        Finally getting my stride, although still not flying. Here I was able to make is so that the computer plays their move autmatically. This was most definitely the most challenging and interesting part of the project.
                    </div>
                    <div class="text">
                        This was a great exercise in learning to interact more with arrays. I was also able to make a counter for my check for a draw function, and I learned to set a time-out to make the computer's turn seem more natural. Yet there is a very subtle bug here. Can you find it?
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="col">
                    <a href="./tic-tac-toe-4"><span>Version<br>Four</span></a>
                    <div class="text">
                        Through a significant amount of productive struggle I was eventually able to have all automated moves by player 2 terminate if play one had already won. It was a real challenge to find the needle in a haystack.
                    </div>
                    <div class="text">
                        Eventually, I was able to add some additional features like keep score of how many games each player had won. I also took an attempt at up-leveling the UI design some and would have liked to do more, however, the next project was already beckoning.
