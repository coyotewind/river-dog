# JS Tic Tac Toe Game

### Description

- The assignment was a game arcade and I opted to do one game really well. This was our first signifcant challenge with complex logic structures.
- I present this projects in a series of four releases to show demonstrate how software projects evolve from MVP to a more finished project
- It can be seen at https://river-dog.netlify.app/

### What I Learned:

- How to work with to dimensional arrays and how to optimize for Big "O".
- Complex projects need to be broken done into small achieveable user stories.
- The goal of a Sprint is to produce a potentially realeaseable increment so that you can get feedback, and make improvements.
- Working with state across multiple data types.

### What I am Proud Of:

- Not going to lie, this was the first time I felt challenged and it broke me down some.
- Yet, with dedication, courage, focus and commitment a suceessful outcome was achieved

### How I Would Uplevel It:

- I would like to try to make more games using REACT instead of jQuery and Vanilla JS.
